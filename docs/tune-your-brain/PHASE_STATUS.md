# Tune Your Brain — Phase Status

**Read this first in any new session before doing more Tune Your Brain work.** Updated at the end of every work package — if it's stale, something was skipped.

## Still-open leadership decisions
See `LEADERSHIP_DECISIONS_REQUIRED.md`. D1 (is ElevenLabs actually live — blocks Phase 5 audio content) and D4 (how aggregate is school-admin visibility — blocks Phase 6 reporting) are the only two still genuinely unanswered.

## What "done" does NOT mean yet
No new game exists. No student, teacher, or admin can see or play anything different from before this work started. Phases 1–2 are exclusively backend/frontend plumbing — the first actually-playable new thing arrives in Phase 5.

## Deploy queue (not yet run on production)
1. Phase 2 static files (`git pull` + rsync — no restart needed).
2. Phase 3: `git pull` + rsync + **Node restart** (new `/api/learning-events` route added to `server/app.js`).

## Engine mapping spike (done)
See `ENGINE_MAPPING_SPIKE.md`. Key finding: the blueprint's own suggested Phase 3 starter engines (Audio Choice, Build, Manipulative, Evidence Hunt, Branching Scenario, Simulation) missed the two cleanest-fitting engines for the 6 legacy games (**Memory**, **Pattern**) entirely, and included one (Manipulative) nothing needs yet. Corrected list: Memory, Pattern, Audio Choice (generalized to any stimulus), Evidence Hunt, Branching Scenario, Simulation.

## Phase 3 progress
Built and verified (via a throwaway Playwright script — screenshots + interaction checks, then deleted): `engine-sdk.js` (lifecycle runner + resume-safe session tracking + `learning_events` logging), `engine-registry` (built into the SDK itself), and the first real engine, **Memory** (`engine-memory.js`), covering Memory Match + Simon Sequence per the spike. Proved the exit gate: two distinct content packs ("Shapes," "Numbers") run on the same engine with zero engine-code changes, under two different bands (Discover/Advance), keyboard-operable, and a page reload resumes the same session (no duplicate). New server route `POST /api/learning-events` (dual-identity, same principle as brain-games.js) gives engines somewhere real to log evidence.

**Real bug caught and fixed during this work, worth remembering:** the flip-card CSS (`.flip-card`/`.card-grid` and friends) had only ever existed as page-local styles inside `brain-memory-match.html`'s own `<style>` block — never in the shared `brain-games.css`. Assumed-shared classes turned out not to be shared at all. Added proper versions to `brain-games.css` now that a second consumer (the Memory engine) needs them. Also hit and fixed a real inline-vs-block CSS bug: `<span class="flip-inner">` is inline by default, so its `width:100%/height:100%` were silently ignored (percentages don't apply to inline elements) — fixed by forcing `display:block` in the shared rule so this can't recur regardless of which tag a future engine uses.

**Pending engines, not yet built:** Pattern, Audio Choice (generalized), Evidence Hunt, Branching Scenario, Simulation. Building only Memory first, matching the "one bounded work package at a time" discipline — Phase 3's exit gate only requires proving the pattern works, not shipping the full 6.

## Next recommended step
Build the remaining 5 engines from the corrected list, OR move to Phase 4 (skill graph seeding + content governance) if the Memory engine alone is judged sufficient proof for now — this is a real scoping choice, not something to decide silently.
